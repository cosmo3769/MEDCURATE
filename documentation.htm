            It is estimated that more than 250,000 children die each year because of Fake Malaria Medicine. The statistics grow worse 
            every year. This is a serious concern for Pharmaceuticals as it not only hampers their repute but also the overall trust of a 
            Customer. Blockchain can address this by uniquely tracking the origin of not just the medicine but even the components of the 
            medicine. If successfully designed, such a Blockchain platform could help eradicate Medicine Mafia and even Middlemen who sell 
            fake medicine. Could you help in successfully building such an innovative and modern System and help in this fight?
